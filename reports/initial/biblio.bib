% Outlines X-Ray tomography and why the technique has not been used (often due to low resolution). Gives range for acoutic methods of 10-30 cm, includes useful plot of characteristic sound made by insect compared to background noise, might be useful to include in overview. Also gives frequency range and intensity of sound from insect.
